      "Deere & Company is a premier industrial franchise navigating a severe cyclical downturn. While its brand is strong, its earnings quality is questionable. The most recent data from <strong>Q4 2025 shows a critical breakdown in cost control, with operating expenses surging +27.7% on flat revenue</strong>. This is compounded by a recurring pattern of building inventory into falling demand (e.g., Q1 2025), which traps cash and signals aggressive production scheduling to absorb fixed costs, artificially boosting short-term margins at the expense of cash flow.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> Be cautious of headline profits and cash flow figures. The recent strong cash flow is not from healthy operations but from liquidating the balance sheet\u2014a temporary and unsustainable source. The real story is in the inventory bloat and runaway costs. If you own the stock, the key metric to watch is the inventory-to-sales growth spread. If the company continues to produce more than it sells, future discounts and margin pressure are almost guaranteed. This is a high-risk period for the stock until operational discipline is restored."

      "<strong>Operating Expense Control:</strong> Q4 2025 saw OpEx grow +27.7% vs. revenue +3.1%. Watch for OpEx growth to fall below revenue growth in the next report. Continued divergence indicates management has lost control of the cost structure.",
      "<strong>Inventory vs. Revenue Spread:</strong> In Q1 2025, inventory grew +7.6% while revenue fell -23.7%. This spread must reverse. If inventory growth continues to outpace revenue growth, it signals more cash will be trapped and future discounting is likely.",
      "<strong>Receivables Quality:</strong> The Q4 2025 receivables drop was an anomaly. Watch for a return to the Q3 2025 trend of inverse divergence (receivables rising as sales fall). This would confirm that dealer financial health is deteriorating."
