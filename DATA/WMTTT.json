          "Walmart remains a dominant force in global retail, demonstrating stable, albeit moderating, revenue growth driven significantly by its expanding e-commerce operations. Recent years (FY24, FY25) have shown strong Net Income performance, reflecting operational leverage and efficiency gains, particularly in inventory management.",
          "The company has successfully strengthened its balance sheet through deleveraging. However, forensic analysis highlights persistent areas requiring scrutiny: Accounts Receivable growth consistently outpacing revenue growth raises concerns about collection efficiency or credit terms, and a notable divergence between strong Net Income growth and weak Operating Cash Flow growth emerged in FY25.",
          "Walmart's future performance hinges on sustaining e-commerce momentum profitably, effectively managing working capital (especially receivables), and leveraging its scale and technology investments to navigate intense competition and potential macroeconomic headwinds. While fundamentally strong, the identified financial statement divergences warrant close monitoring."
