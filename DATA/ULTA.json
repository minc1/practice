      "ULTA Beauty has transitioned rapidly from a strong post-pandemic recovery phase to a period of <strong>significant growth deceleration</strong>, with revenue nearly flat in FY2024 (+0.8%). While the company demonstrated impressive profit recovery initially, margins have come under pressure, leading to a <strong>Net Income decline (-7.0%)</strong> in FY2024.",
      "The most critical forensic finding is the <strong>substantial inventory build-up</strong>, particularly in FY2024 (Inventory +13.0% vs. COGS +1.2%). This has directly contributed to a concerning <strong>divergence between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow</strong> in both FY2023 and FY2024, straining cash generation and raising questions about demand forecasting and potential future margin pressure from discounting or write-offs.",
      "Despite these challenges, ULTA retains strengths in its <strong>leading market position, strong brand loyalty, and conservative balance sheet</strong> with minimal debt. However, the combination of slowing growth, contracting margins, and significant inventory/cash flow red flags warrants a <strong>cautious investment stance</strong>. Management's ability to navigate this 'transitional' period and effectively manage inventory will be crucial."
