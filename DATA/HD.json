      "Home Depot remains a dominant force in retail, but its recent financial reporting raises serious questions about the quality of its earnings. The most glaring issue is the <strong>critical divergence in Q3 2025, where revenue fell 8.7% while accounts receivable grew 15.1%</strong>. This suggests the company is either struggling to collect cash from its customers or is aggressively booking future sales to meet current-quarter targets\u2014a practice that is unsustainable and often precedes earnings disappointments.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The profits HD is reporting may not be real, cash-in-the-bank profits. They are increasingly 'paper profits' tied up in uncollected bills and unsold inventory. Be cautious of earnings beats driven by these metrics. Before considering an investment, you should demand to see <strong>cash flow from operations growing in line with net income and receivables growth slowing to match sales growth</strong>. The current trends are yellow flags turning red, signaling potential future write-downs and earnings misses."

      "<strong>Receivables vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> In Q3 2025, receivables grew while revenue shrank. Watch for this ratio in the next report. If receivables growth again outpaces revenue growth by more than 2x, it confirms aggressive accounting.",
      "<strong>Inventory vs. Sales Growth:</strong> In Q3 2025, inventory grew +5.5% as sales fell -8.7%. This signals a product glut. If inventory does not decline in the next quarter, expect significant discounts that will crush profit margins.",
      "<strong>Cash Conversion (OCF/NI Ratio):</strong> Recent quarters showed poor conversion of profit to cash. Watch if Operating Cash Flow growth can match or exceed Net Income growth. If it lags again, the 'paper profits' problem is getting worse."
