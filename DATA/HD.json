          "Home Depot navigated the pandemic boom successfully but now faces challenges from market normalization, macroeconomic pressures, and strategic shifts. While FY2024 saw a modest revenue recovery, <strong>profitability remained under pressure</strong>, with both Operating and Net Income declining, indicating persistent margin compression.",
          "Forensic analysis reveals significant concerns, most notably a massive <strong>47% surge in Accounts Receivable in FY2024</strong>, vastly outpacing revenue growth. While likely impacted by the large SRS Distribution acquisition, this anomaly requires close scrutiny regarding credit quality and cash conversion. Furthermore, the company took on substantial debt for the acquisition, leading to <strong>increased leverage</strong> and a concerning <strong>decline in interest coverage ratios</strong>.",
          "While HD retains market leadership and the SRS acquisition offers long-term strategic potential, the near-term financial profile carries increased risk. Investors should carefully monitor the integration progress, management of the expanded receivables balance, efforts to restore margins, and the trajectory of leverage and coverage ratios. The pause in share buybacks also removes a previous tailwind."
