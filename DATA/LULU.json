      "Lululemon boasts a decade of impressive growth and maintains a strong brand and robust balance sheet with minimal debt. However, analysis reveals a <strong>clear growth deceleration in FY2024</strong>, corroborated by weak FY2025 guidance, particularly citing softness in the core US market.",
      "Forensic analysis highlights historical operational challenges, notably the <strong>significant inventory build-up in FY2022</strong> that pressured margins and cash flow. While corrected in FY2023, recent quarterly data shows continued working capital volatility impacting OCF. The <strong>Q4 2024 disconnect</strong> between surging QoQ revenue and stalled QoQ profit/OCF growth, alongside guidance for <strong>FY2025 margin contraction</strong>, raises concerns about future profitability.",
      "While LULU's financial health remains sound, the investment profile is shifting from hyper-growth to moderate growth facing headwinds. Investors must weigh the opportunities in international markets and new categories against the risks of <strong>sustained slower growth, margin pressure, and potential OCF volatility</strong> linked to inventory management."
