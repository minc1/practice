      "Lululemon is currently exhibiting a classic forensic 'red flag' pattern where reported profits are diverging sharply from cash reality. In <strong>Q3 2025, A/R growth of 79.7%</strong> against a mere 1.6% revenue gain suggests that the company is either struggling to collect cash from wholesale partners or is pulling forward future sales to meet targets. This is compounded by an <strong>inventory build that is 10x faster than sales growth</strong>, creating a high risk of future markdowns that will impair gross margins.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> If you are an investor, you should prioritize <strong>cash flow over reported earnings</strong> in the coming quarters. The current disconnect suggests that Lululemon's 'beats' may be driven by accounting adjustments rather than selling more products. <strong>Exercise caution</strong> and watch for a significant contraction in receivables; until cash collection aligns with sales, the stock carries a higher risk of a sudden valuation correction."
