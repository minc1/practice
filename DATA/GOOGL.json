      "Alphabet's dominant market position is reflected in its resilient growth and powerful cash generation. However, recent financial reports require careful interpretation. In <strong>Q3 2025, core operating income was flat (-0.1%)</strong> despite solid revenue growth, as a +41.9% surge in G&A expenses from legal and restructuring charges erased gains. While headline Net Income appeared strong, it was supported by non-operating items, creating a disconnect between reported profit and the actual performance of the core search and cloud businesses.",
      "<strong>What This Means For You:</strong> The key takeaway is to look past the headline Net Income number. The company's core business is healthy, but its profitability is being obscured by large, recurring 'one-off' costs. Before investing, <strong>focus on Operating Income growth, excluding these charges if possible</strong>. If this core profit metric remains stagnant as revenue grows, it signals that cost pressures are structural, not temporary. This is a yellow flag that warrants deeper investigation, not an immediate sell signal."

      "<strong>Operating Income Growth:</strong> In Q3 2025, this was -0.1%. Watch for a return to sustained positive growth (e.g., >5%) to confirm that core business profitability is improving and not just being propped up by non-operating items.",
      "<strong>Cash Conversion (OCF vs NI):</strong> Q3 2025 saw a strong rebound with OCF growth far outpacing NI growth. Monitor if this continues. If OCF growth consistently lags NI growth again, it would signal a return to lower-quality, accrual-driven earnings.",
      "<strong>G&A Expense Growth:</strong> In Q3 2025, this was +41.9%. While some volatility is expected, watch for this growth rate to normalize back toward the single digits. Persistently high growth would indicate that 'one-time' charges are becoming a permanent feature."
