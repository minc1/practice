        "Alibaba has transitioned from a hyper-growth powerhouse to a more mature entity facing significant deceleration in its core domestic commerce segment due to competition and macroeconomic factors. While FY2024 showed moderate revenue recovery, growth remains far below historical levels.",
        "A critical forensic finding is the <strong>persistent and significant divergence between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow (OCF)</strong>. Net Income is highly volatile due to investment mark-to-market changes, while OCF, though historically strong, has recently come under pressure from heavy investments (especially in Cloud/AI) and working capital needs, raising concerns about near-term Free Cash Flow generation and the quality of reported earnings.",
        "Despite these challenges, BABA maintains a strong balance sheet with low leverage and a substantial cash position. Future prospects hinge on the success of growth initiatives in Cloud (AI-driven) and International Commerce (AIDC), stabilizing core commerce, and the effectiveness of its large share buyback program in returning value amidst market and regulatory uncertainties."
