      "Deere & Co.'s FY2025 performance presents a deceptive picture of financial health. While the company generated strong operating cash flow, the Q4 2025 results reveal a worrying trend in core profitability. A <strong>+27.7% surge in operating expenses</strong> completely erased strong gross margin gains, causing operating margins to contract -17.0%. The headline cash flow strength was not from selling more tractors but from a massive, non-recurring 87% reduction in receivables, which is not a sustainable source of cash.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> Don't be fooled by the strong cash flow number this quarter; it's likely a one-off accounting event. The real story is the squeeze on profits from rising costs. The key risk is the growing pile of inventory, which could force future price cuts. Before considering an investment, <strong>watch for operating expenses to normalize</strong> and for inventory levels to start shrinking relative to sales. This would prove management has costs under control and that customer demand is healthy."

      "<strong>Cash Conversion Source:</strong> Q4 2025 OCF was boosted by an 87% receivables drop. Future reports must show OCF being driven by Net Income, not one-time working capital releases, to confirm sustainable cash generation from the core business."
