      "Procter & Gamble is a blue-chip consumer staple that has successfully used its pricing power to navigate inflation. However, its quality of earnings is a significant concern. The most recent quarter, Q1 FY2026, continues a troubling trend: <strong>Net Income grew an impressive +31.4%, but Operating Cash Flow grew only +8.5%</strong>. This 23-point gap means the reported profits are not being fully converted into cash, a pattern also seen in FY2025 and during the receivables crisis of FY2024.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> Be cautious of headline earnings-per-share (EPS) beats. While the stock may rise on strong profit numbers, those profits are not entirely real until they become cash. The recurring gap suggests that to hit its numbers, the company is either booking sales too early or tying up significant cash in its operations. Your focus should be on the cash flow statement, not just the income statement. <strong>Look for the OCF/NI ratio to get consistently above 1.0x</strong> before trusting that the reported earnings growth is sustainable and creating real value."

      "<strong>Receivables vs. Revenue Growth (Sales Quality):</strong> In Q1 FY2026, receivables grew slower than revenue (a good sign). Monitor this to ensure it continues. If receivables growth again outpaces revenue growth, it signals a return to aggressive sales tactics.",
      "<strong>Inventory vs. Revenue Growth (Demand Signal):</strong> In Q1 FY2026, revenue growth (+7.2%) outpaced inventory growth (+3.9%). If inventory growth again exceeds revenue growth, it indicates that demand is slowing and products are piling up, risking future write-downs."
