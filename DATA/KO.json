          "Coca-Cola leverages its iconic brand and global reach to deliver resilient <strong>organic revenue growth</strong>, primarily through effective pricing strategies. However, reported results often show volatility due to currency impacts and strategic shifts like refranchising.",
          "Despite underlying operational strength, recent financial performance raises significant concerns, headlined by a sharp <strong>decline in Operating Cash Flow (-41.3% in FY2024)</strong> that starkly contrasts with relatively stable Net Income. This divergence, attributed partly to tax payments and working capital swings, demands close scrutiny regarding earnings quality and cash conversion efficiency.",
          "While KO remains a 'Dividend Aristocrat' with a strong market position, the combination of inconsistent reported growth, profitability pressures, and particularly the significant OCF deterioration warrants a <strong>cautious outlook</strong>. Investors must monitor the normalization of cash flows to ensure the sustainability of shareholder returns and validate the quality of reported earnings."
