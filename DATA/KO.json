      "Coca-Cola's powerful brand allows it to pass on price increases, but this strength is being undermined by deteriorating financial discipline. The most alarming signal is the <strong>FY2024 operating cash flow collapse of -41.3%</strong>, a stark contrast to nearly flat net income. This demonstrates that reported profits are not converting to cash. This issue is compounded by a recurring pattern of aggressive Q1 channel stuffing, where sales are booked far in advance of collection, creating a fragile, accrual-driven earnings profile.",

The company appears to be pushing products to distributors and borrowing money to cover the resulting cash shortfall. Be cautious of 'earnings beats' that are not accompanied by strong operating cash flow. For now, this is a significant yellow flag. You should demand to see <strong>inventory levels fall and cash flow consistently exceed net income</strong> before trusting that the reported earnings are real."
