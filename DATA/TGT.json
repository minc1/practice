          "Target Corporation navigated a tumultuous period, marked by a pandemic-driven surge, a severe <strong>FY2022 profitability crisis</strong> due to inventory and margin issues, and an impressive <strong>FY2023 margin recovery</strong>. However, recent performance (FY2023-FY2024) shows a concerning trend of <strong>revenue stagnation and flattening profit growth</strong>, indicating challenges in the current macroeconomic environment.",
          "Forensic analysis highlights several key areas requiring scrutiny. The most prominent is the <strong>significant divergence between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow</strong> in FY2023 and FY2024, largely driven by volatile working capital changes, particularly inventory swings. Additionally, the trend of <strong>Accounts Receivable growing faster than declining revenue</strong> warrants monitoring for collection efficiency. On a positive note, Target executed a <strong>massive deleveraging in FY2024</strong>, substantially strengthening its balance sheet.",
          "Target retains strengths in its <strong>brand, omnichannel capabilities, and recently improved financial flexibility</strong>. However, investors must weigh these against the risks of slowing growth, potential margin pressures, OCF volatility tied to working capital management, and sensitivity to consumer spending. The cautious outlook suggests near-term headwinds persist, making a <strong>neutral stance appropriate</strong> while closely monitoring key operational and financial metrics."
