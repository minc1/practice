      "Tesla is navigating a significant transition, moving decisively away from its era of <strong>explosive, high-margin growth</strong> (FY20-FY22). The past two years (FY23-FY24) have been marked by a dramatic <strong>revenue deceleration</strong> (to +1.0% in FY24) and, more critically, severe <strong>margin compression</strong>. Aggressive price cuts and heightened competition have led to negative Gross Profit and Operating Income growth, culminating in a sharp Net Income decline (-52.5%) in FY24.",
      "Forensic analysis highlights key concerns, including the <strong>divergence between Accounts Receivable growth (+25.9%) and near-flat Revenue growth (+1.0%) in FY24</strong>, suggesting potential collection issues. Furthermore, the significant volatility and periodic divergence between <strong>Operating Cash Flow and Net Income</strong>, driven by large working capital swings, warrant close monitoring despite OCF remaining positive. Free Cash Flow has also notably declined from its 2022 peak.",
      "While Tesla maintains a <strong>strong balance sheet with low debt</strong> and continues to innovate, the current financial trends paint a challenging picture. The company's ability to stabilize margins, manage cash flow effectively amidst slower growth, and successfully execute on future catalysts (new models, FSD) is critical. Given the decelerating growth, profitability pressures, and high valuation, a <strong>cautious investment stance</strong> is advised."
