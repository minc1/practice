      "Visa operates one of the world's most dominant business franchises, benefiting from the global secular shift towards digital payments. However, this operational strength has been periodically overshadowed by significant earnings quality concerns. While the most recent quarter showed marked improvement, with <strong>strong operating leverage in Q4 2025</strong>, this follows a troubling pattern. Fiscal 2024 was a notable example, where receivables grew 5.7 times faster than revenue, leading to poor cash conversion and suggesting profits were more accrual-driven (recorded on paper, not yet cash) than cash-backed.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The core business is excellent, but the accounting practices can be aggressive. The recent improvement in Q4 2025 is a positive sign, but it's just one quarter. You should view the stock with cautious optimism. The key is to verify that this improvement is a new trend, not just a temporary cleanup. Before getting more confident, you need to see if the <strong>A/R-to-Revenue growth ratio stays below 2.0x</strong> for at least two more quarters. If it spikes again, it confirms a pattern of using accounting levers to hit numbers, which increases risk."

      "<strong>Receivables vs. Revenue Growth (Revenue Quality):</strong> The ratio was healthy in Q4 2025 as A/R fell. Watch if this ratio remains below 2.0x in upcoming quarters. A return to the 5.7x level seen in FY2024 would be a critical red flag.",
      "<strong>Cash Conversion (Earnings Quality):</strong> OCF growth slightly lagged NI growth in Q4 2025. Watch for OCF growth to consistently match or exceed NI growth. A repeat of the Q1 2024 scenario (OCF -47.8% vs. NI +4.5%) would signal a return of 'paper profits'.",
      "<strong>Operating Leverage (Profitability):</strong> Operating income grew 2.6x faster than revenue in Q4 2025. Monitor if operating income continues to outpace revenue growth. This confirms cost discipline and the sustainability of Visa's high margins."
