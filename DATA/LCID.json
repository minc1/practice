            "Lucid Motors exemplifies a capital-intensive EV startup navigating the 'valley of death,' with its financial viability entirely contingent on Saudi Arabia's PIF. While FY2024 showed revenue recovery (+35.7%) and narrowing losses (Net Income growth +4.0%), forensic analysis reveals <strong>persistent cash burn</strong> (FY2024 OCF -$2.9B) and <strong>working capital anomalies</strong>, particularly in Inventory (-41.4%) and A/R (+1.2%) growth rates. The Q4 2024 divergence between Net Income (+60.0%) and OCF (-15.2%) underscores earnings quality risks.",
            "The company's <strong>liquidity lifeline</strong> ($6.1B end-FY2024) provides a 2-year runway, but reliance on PIF introduces strategic concentration risk. Equity dilution (Common Stock growth +31.7% in FY2024) and volatile debt (Short-Term Debt growth -90.6%) complicate the capital structure. Production targets (20K vehicles in 2025) must be met to justify valuation, yet historical misses and negative gross margins temper optimism.",
            "LCID presents a binary investment proposition: <strong>technology leadership and PIF backing</strong> versus <strong>operational execution and cash burn</strong>. The forensic flags—Inventory/COGS mismatches, OCF/NI gaps, and SBC volatility—demand scrutiny. Success hinges on Gravity SUV adoption and cost control, while failure risks spiraling dilution or PIF intervention."
