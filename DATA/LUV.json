          "Southwest Airlines successfully navigated the pandemic-induced downturn, achieving record revenues in the recovery. However, growth has significantly decelerated, and profitability faced substantial pressure in 2023 before stabilizing somewhat in 2024. The company maintains an investment-grade rating and is actively reducing debt accumulated during the crisis.",
          "The most critical forensic finding is the <strong>severe deterioration in Operating Cash Flow (OCF) in FY2024 (-85.4%)</strong>, leading to negative Free Cash Flow despite flat Net Income. This stark divergence, primarily driven by unfavorable working capital changes (specifically Accounts Payable), raises significant concerns about the quality and sustainability of underlying cash generation. Persistent NI vs. OCF divergences historically underscore this risk.",
          "While LUV benefits from a strong brand and is pursuing cost-cutting and revenue initiatives, the recent OCF weakness overshadows the positive deleveraging efforts. The combination of slowing growth, stagnant net income, and critically weak cash flow necessitates a <strong>cautious investment stance</strong>, pending clear evidence of OCF recovery and successful execution of strategic adjustments."
