          "Walmart presents a duality: a remarkably stable top-line performer with consistent, moderate revenue growth reflecting its market dominance, contrasted by significant volatility beneath the surface in its profitability and cash flow generation. While recent years (FY24-FY25) show strong rebounds in Net Income, the decade-long history and quarterly data reveal frequent, large swings.",
          "The most critical forensic finding is the persistent and substantial divergence between reported Net Income and Operating Cash Flow. This disconnect, driven primarily by large fluctuations in working capital (highlighted by the FY22 inventory surge and variable A/R trends) and non-cash/non-operating items, makes reported earnings an unreliable predictor of near-term cash generation and raises questions about earnings quality consistency.",
          "Walmart actively manages its capital structure, undertaking significant debt-funded initiatives like the Flipkart acquisition (FY19) and another large debt increase in FY25. While leverage appears manageable overall, the impact of these events and recent anomalies like the Q4'25 interest expense spike require careful monitoring. Investors should prioritize analyzing cash flow trends, working capital efficiency, and the returns generated from strategic investments over relying solely on volatile net income figures."
