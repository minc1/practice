      "Amazon is a world-class operator with dominant platforms in commerce and cloud. While its growth and profitability are impressive, its earnings quality has been inconsistent. The company has a history of periods where cash flow significantly lags reported profit, most notably in FY2021. While FY2024 showed marked improvement in revenue quality, the gap between cash flow and net income growth remains a key concern. <strong>The 58 percentage point divergence in FY2024</strong>, where OCF grew +36.4% while NI surged +94.7%, shows that a significant portion of its record profits were not yet converted into cash.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The key risk is that you might be paying for 'paper profits' (earnings not yet backed by cash). While Amazon's scale makes this less of a solvency issue, it can mean the stock's valuation gets ahead of its true cash-generating power. You should view the reported earnings per share with some skepticism until cash flow consistently catches up. <strong>Consider the Operating Cash Flow per share</strong> as a more reliable indicator of the company's health than the headline Net Income figure. This is a yellow flag that requires monitoring, not a red flag demanding a sale."

      "<strong>A/R vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> In FY2024, the ratio was a healthy 0.56x. Watch for this ratio climbing above 1.5x in future reports, as it would signal that customers are taking longer to pay or that sales are being booked too aggressively.",
      "<strong>OCF vs. NI Growth Gap:</strong> The gap was 58 p.p. in FY2024. Monitor if this gap narrows in the coming year. A sustained gap suggests that the high net income growth is not translating into real cash, which is a core tenet of value creation.",
      "<strong>Operating Leverage:</strong> FY2024 showed strong margin expansion on 11% revenue growth. Watch for continued operating margin expansion during periods of revenue growth. If margins contract while revenue grows, it signals a return to heavy, profit-compressing investment cycles."
