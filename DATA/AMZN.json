          "Amazon navigated a period of extreme volatility, from the pandemic-fueled boom of 2020-2021 to a challenging <strong>2022 marked by slowing growth and profitability pressures</strong>. However, FY2023-FY2024 demonstrated a significant turnaround, with revenue growth stabilizing and <strong>profitability surging dramatically</strong>, driven by successful cost optimization efforts and the continued strength of high-margin AWS and Advertising segments.",
          "Forensic analysis reveals historical inconsistencies that warrant attention, particularly the <strong>divergences between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow growth</strong> (notably in 2021 and 2023), largely explained by volatile working capital movements. Past concerns regarding <strong>Accounts Receivable and Inventory growth outpacing sales</strong> appear to have been addressed in recent periods, indicating improved operational efficiency. The company has also shifted towards strengthening its balance sheet through recent deleveraging.",
          "While the recovery is impressive, Amazon's financial profile remains characterized by <strong>inherent volatility and sensitivity to macro conditions</strong>. The company faces ongoing competitive and regulatory pressures. Investment hinges on the sustainability of recent margin improvements, continued momentum in AWS/Ads, and disciplined capital allocation. The outlook is <strong>positive but carries medium risk</strong> due to historical volatility and external challenges."
