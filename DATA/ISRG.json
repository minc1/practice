          "Intuitive Surgical demonstrates a robust growth profile, marked by a strong recovery from the pandemic and recent re-acceleration fueled by its market leadership and the launch of the da Vinci 5 system. The company boasts <strong>exceptional financial health</strong>, characterized by a <strong>zero-debt balance sheet</strong>, strong profitability, and growth funded primarily through retained earnings.",
          "However, forensic analysis highlights a key area for scrutiny: a <strong>significant inventory build-up</strong> from 2022 through 2024, where inventory growth consistently outpaced COGS growth. While likely strategic preparation for the da Vinci 5 launch, this trend has negatively impacted operating cash flow relative to net income and carries risks of obsolescence or future write-downs if demand falters or the transition is prolonged. This working capital volatility contributes to fluctuations in OCF.",
          "Overall, ISRG presents a compelling case based on its market dominance, innovation pipeline, and financial strength. Yet, investors should weigh these positives against the risks associated with <strong>managing the current inventory levels</strong>, potential <strong>near-term margin pressures</strong> guided for 2025 due to launch costs, and the <strong>high valuation</strong> reflecting significant growth expectations. A positive long-term outlook seems warranted, but careful monitoring of execution is crucial."
