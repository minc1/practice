      "Intuitive Surgical is the undisputed leader in robotic-assisted surgery, a position built on decades of innovation. However, recent performance reveals operational strain. While Q3 2025 showed a healthy recovery in cash conversion, it followed a period of significant stress in Q1 2025, where OCF collapsed -29.3% despite positive net income, driven by a large inventory build. This pattern of 'paper profits' also occurred in Q4 2023, indicating that earnings quality is periodically weak and reliant on accruals.",
      "The forward-looking thesis hinges on whether these working capital issues are temporary, strategic investments for the da Vinci 5 launch, or a symptom of deteriorating operational control. The fortress balance sheet provides a substantial buffer, but investors should not ignore the cash flow volatility. A sustained improvement, where OCF consistently backs NI and inventory growth normalizes, would be required to downgrade the risk rating. Conversely, another quarter of severe cash burn from working capital would confirm a structural problem."

      "<strong>Inventory vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> Q1 2025 showed a critical divergence. A return to inventory growth tracking at or below revenue growth for two consecutive quarters is needed to resolve this primary flag.",
      "<strong>OCF vs. NI Growth Gap:</strong> Q1 2025 gap was -31.2pp. This gap must remain within a +/-10pp band going forward to demonstrate that earnings are consistently backed by cash, not just accruals.",
      "<strong>Operating Margin Leverage:</strong> Q1 2025 saw margins collapse -15.7% on a revenue decline. The company must demonstrate positive operating leverage (margin expansion on revenue growth) in Q4 2025 to validate its pricing power."
