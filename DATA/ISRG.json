            "Intuitive Surgical stands out as the dominant force in robotic surgery, demonstrating resilient growth driven by increasing da Vinci procedure volumes and system placements. Following a pandemic-induced dip in 2020 and margin pressures in 2022, the company returned to <strong>robust revenue and profitability growth</strong> in 2023 and 2024, underpinned by an <strong>exceptionally strong, debt-free balance sheet</strong>.",
            "Despite the clear strengths, forensic analysis highlights areas requiring scrutiny. The most significant is the <strong>persistent build-up of inventory</strong>, which has consistently outpaced cost of revenue growth from FY2022 through FY2024. While potentially related to supply chain buffering or new product launches (da Vinci 5), this trend poses a risk if sales conversion slows. Additionally, <strong>volatile working capital changes</strong> significantly impact quarterly operating cash flow predictability.",

However, the inventory build-up needs careful monitoring alongside procedure volume trends and competitive dynamics. While fundamentally strong, the company's <strong>high valuation</strong> adds a layer of risk, making execution on growth expectations critical."
