      "Apple's financial history depicts a transition from unparalleled hyper-growth (pre-2013) to a mature, cyclical technology leader. While recent years (FY23-FY24) show <strong>slowing revenue growth and margin pressure</strong> on core hardware, the company's foundation remains exceptionally strong, anchored by its powerful ecosystem and the high-margin <strong>Services segment</strong>.",
      "Forensic analysis highlights strong seasonality and significant working capital swings impacting quarterly results and driving divergences between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow. A key concern emerging from annual data is the <strong>persistent inventory build-up in FY23 and FY24 relative to declining COGS</strong>, warranting close monitoring for potential demand weakness. Anomalies like the Q4'24 Net Income drop were confirmed as non-operational (tax charge).",
      "Apple's financial strategy is dominated by returning capital to shareholders via <strong>massive, consistent share buybacks</strong>, significantly boosting EPS but shrinking the equity base. Despite recent growth moderation and specific flags like inventory levels, Apple's immense cash flow generation, ecosystem strength, and potential from Services and AI initiatives provide substantial resilience. Investors should focus on the trajectory of Services growth, iPhone demand dynamics (especially in China), and inventory turnover trends."
