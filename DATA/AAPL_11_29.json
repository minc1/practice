      "Apple's long-term financial arc depicts a successful transition from a volatile hardware manufacturer to a high-margin, services-led compounder. However, the <strong>2025 fiscal year reveals significant cracks in this narrative</strong>. The year was characterized by extreme 'boom-bust' quarterly volatility and a concerning divergence where Net Income surged (+19.5%) while Operating Cash Flow declined (-5.7%), driven by a sharp unwinding of supplier payables.",
      "Forensic analysis identifies a <strong>critical red flag in Q4 2025</strong>: Net Receivables grew +55.8% against Revenue growth of only +9.0%. This 6.2x divergence strongly suggests 'channel stuffing'\u2014pulling forward future demand by extending credit terms to partners. Additionally, the sudden flatlining of R&D growth (0%) in Q4 2025, amidst an AI arms race, raises questions about cost management priorities versus long-term innovation.",
      "While the ecosystem moat and gross margin expansion remain formidable, the combination of <strong>'cash-light' earnings, aggressive revenue recognition signals, and working capital drag</strong> warrants a cautious stance. Investors must closely monitor whether the receivables spike unwinds naturally or leads to write-offs, and if R&D investment re-accelerates to defend the competitive edge."
