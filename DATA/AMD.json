          "AMD has navigated a period of extreme growth, strategic transformation via the <strong>Xilinx acquisition</strong>, a cyclical downturn, and a strong recent recovery primarily fueled by the <strong>Data Center and AI markets</strong>. The company demonstrated robust revenue growth capabilities and, despite significant GAAP profitability volatility linked to acquisition accounting, has generated strong underlying operating cash flow.",
          "This strong cash generation has enabled AMD to significantly <strong>strengthen its balance sheet</strong> through substantial debt reduction in FY2024 and initiate share buybacks. However, a key risk highlighted by forensic analysis is the <strong>persistent growth of inventory outpacing cost of goods sold</strong>, particularly notable again in FY2024. This raises concerns about potential future write-downs or demand mismatches, especially in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.",
          "Overall, AMD presents a compelling growth story centered on its expanding presence in high-margin markets like Data Center and AI, backed by improving financial health. However, investors must weigh these opportunities against the inherent cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the significant, ongoing risk associated with <strong>managing high inventory levels</strong>. Continued execution and effective inventory control are critical for sustaining momentum."
