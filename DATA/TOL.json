      "Toll Brothers operates effectively as a luxury homebuilder, leveraging its brand to achieve impressive pricing power and operating leverage, as seen in the strong margin performance in Q2 2025. However, the quality of these earnings is questionable. The company's core strategy involves converting profits directly into inventory, leading to <strong>massive divergences between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow (-96.4 points in Q2 2025)</strong>. While this has been a successful bet on future demand, it means reported profits are consistently non-cash and reinvested into balance sheet risk.",
      "The primary risk is a cyclical downturn where the company's large inventory position becomes a liability. A change in verdict would require a fundamental shift in financial reporting, where <strong>OCF growth consistently outpaces Net Income growth</strong>, proving that profits are translating into distributable cash. Until then, the recurring revenue quality flags from periods like FY2023 and the persistent cash conversion deficit classify the earnings quality as poor, despite the company's operational strengths."

      "<strong>OCF vs. NI Conversion:</strong> The gap was a critical -96.4 points in Q2 2025. This divergence must narrow to less than -20 points for two consecutive peak quarters (Q2/Q4) to signal an improvement in earnings quality.",
      "<strong>A/R vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> The ratio was an elevated 3.1x in Q3 2024 and worse in FY2023. Any future quarter where this ratio exceeds 2.5x, particularly if revenue is flat or declining, would be a critical red flag.",
      "<strong>Inventory Growth vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> In Q1 2025, inventory grew +9.9% while revenue fell -44.2%. This strategic build must be validated by strong revenue growth in subsequent quarters; failure to do so would signal a costly miscalculation."
