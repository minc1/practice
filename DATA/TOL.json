      "Toll Brothers, a leader in luxury homebuilding, is currently demonstrating powerful operational execution with accelerating revenue and expanding margins. However, this impressive performance is undermined by poor earnings quality. The most recent data from Q2 and Q3 2025 confirms this trend: while revenue grew +7.5% in Q3, the preceding quarter saw a critical 96.4 percentage point gap between NI growth (+98.3%) and OCF growth (+1.9%), driven by a massive inventory build.",
      "The company's strategy is a calculated gamble on sustained housing demand. If new orders remain strong, the inventory will convert to highly profitable cash flow. However, if demand falters due to interest rate hikes or economic weakness, the company faces significant write-down risk. The verdict would improve if OCF begins to consistently track or exceed Net Income, validating the current strategy. Conversely, a slowdown in new orders alongside continued inventory growth would signal a critical miscalculation and warrant a downgrade."

      "<strong>Inventory Growth vs. New Orders:</strong> Inventory grew +9.9% in Q1 2025. This must be validated by YoY new order growth exceeding 10% in upcoming reports. A divergence would signal a critical mismatch between supply and demand.",
      "<strong>OCF vs. NI Growth:</strong> Q2 2025 showed a 96.4pp negative divergence. This gap must narrow significantly; a sustained OCF/NI ratio below 0.8x for the full fiscal year would confirm a systemic cash conversion problem.",
      "<strong>Net Debt:</strong> Net Debt surged +38.6% in Q1 2025 to fund inventory. A return to a net debt reduction trajectory in subsequent quarters is necessary to confirm that inventory is successfully converting to cash and fortifying the balance sheet."
