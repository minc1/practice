          "BP's financial performance is dominated by <strong>extreme cyclical volatility</strong> inherent in the energy sector, evident in dramatic swings across revenue, profitability, and cash flow over the past decade. The strong rebound seen in 2021-2022 reversed sharply in 2023-2024, culminating in a <strong>near-total collapse of Net Income (-97.5%) in FY2024</strong> alongside significant declines in Operating Income and Operating Cash Flow.",
          "Forensic analysis consistently reveals a <strong>significant and persistent divergence between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow</strong>, driven by large non-cash items (impairments) and volatile working capital movements tied to commodity prices. This makes Net Income an unreliable indicator of cash generation. Recent anomalies in Accounts Receivable and Inventory growth relative to declining sales (FY2024) also raise concerns about collection quality and inventory management.",
          "While BP can generate substantial cash flow during favorable cycles, the recent profit collapse, weakening OCF, significantly <strong>increasing leverage (rising debt, falling equity in FY2024)</strong>, and deteriorating interest coverage paint a concerning picture. The combination of high market volatility and weakening financial metrics necessitates a <strong>high degree of caution</strong> for investors."
