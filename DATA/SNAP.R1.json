      "SNAP demonstrates a fragile turnaround, achieving its <strong>first quarterly GAAP profit</strong> in Q4 2024 (+$9M) through ad platform improvements and cost discipline. While 2024 revenue growth reaccelerated to +16.4% and Adjusted EBITDA tripled, the company remains exposed to <strong>working capital volatility</strong> (2024 OCF swung from -46% Q1 to +99% Q4) and <strong>high fixed costs</strong> (SBC + infrastructure).",
      "Critical forensic flags include <strong>persistent OCF/NI divergence</strong> driven by $1B+ annual SBC and erratic WC changes, alongside <strong>leverage risks</strong> from $4.2B debt. However, refinancing extended maturities, and $3.4B cash provides runway to execute its AR-driven growth strategy.",
