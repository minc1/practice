        "Coinbase's financial performance is inextricably linked to the volatile cryptocurrency markets, resulting in extreme boom-and-bust cycles in revenue and profitability. While FY2024 marked a strong recovery with a return to significant profitability, this was heavily influenced by favorable market conditions and non-cash items like crypto asset gains.",
        "Significant forensic red flags persist, primarily the <strong>large and recurring divergence between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow</strong>, driven by substantial non-cash expenses (like SBC) and volatile working capital movements. Additionally, the recurring negative correlation between Revenue and Accounts Receivable growth requires explanation. Investors must also understand the significant impact of the <strong>SAB 122 accounting change</strong>, which removed customer assets/liabilities from the balance sheet in late 2024, drastically altering its reported size.",
        "An investment in COIN is a direct bet on the crypto ecosystem's health and volatility. While diversification efforts and cost controls are positive steps, the company's fortunes remain highly sensitive to external market forces and regulatory developments, making it a high-risk proposition demanding close scrutiny of cash flow quality and underlying operational trends."
