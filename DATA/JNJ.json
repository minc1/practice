          "<strong>Operating Leverage:</strong> Q3 2025 showed a positive reversal, with operating margins expanding +3.1%. This was driven by cost of goods sold falling -4.3% even as revenue grew +1.1%, a favorable but potentially unsustainable dynamic."

The primary concern in <strong>Q3 2025 is an inventory build that grew 5.2 times faster than revenue</strong> (+5.5% vs +1.1%), a potential indicator of slowing end-market demand. This follows a period of critical receivables stress in FY2024, suggesting a persistent pattern of using the balance sheet to manage earnings, a hallmark of lower-quality financial reporting.",

The shift from a receivables issue to an inventory issue is a significant yellow flag. While the company's dividend is not in immediate danger, this pattern of using <strong>accounting levers and debt to manage its operating cycle</strong> is a lower-quality way to run a business. You should question whether the reported earnings per share fully reflects the underlying business performance."

      "<strong>Receivables vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> While clean in Q3 2025, this ratio hit a critical 78.1x in Q4 2024. Monitor for any return to a ratio above 2.5x. This would signal a return to aggressive sales recognition (booking sales before cash is likely).",
