      "Tesla's financial narrative has decisively shifted from an era of hyper-growth and expanding profitability to a challenging period of <strong>stagnating annual revenue, a severe margin reset, and deteriorating earnings quality</strong>. The strategic pivot to prioritize volume over price has successfully defended market share but has come at the cost of financial health, introducing extreme volatility into quarterly results.",
      "Forensic analysis reveals several significant red flags. The most critical is the divergence where <strong>Net Receivables growth vastly outpaced near-zero revenue growth in 2024</strong>, a classic indicator of aggressive sales tactics that questions the quality of reported revenue. This is compounded by clear evidence of operational missteps, including a massive inventory build-up followed by a rapid liquidation, which drove recent 'paper profits' not backed by sustainable cash flow.",
      "While Tesla's strong balance sheet and continued investment in R&D provide a long-term foundation, the combination of eroded pricing power, questionable earnings quality, and specific forensic flags warrants a <strong>cautious investment stance</strong>. The company's ability to stabilize margins, improve operational discipline, and prove the quality of its revenue growth are now the most critical factors for its future valuation."
