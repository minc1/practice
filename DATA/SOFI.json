          "SoFi has navigated a significant transition, evolving from a hyper-growth fintech focused on lending to a diversified financial services platform that achieved its first <strong>GAAP profitable quarters starting in late 2023</strong>. This marks a crucial inflection point, demonstrating progress beyond pure revenue expansion.",
          "However, this profitability milestone coincides with a clear <strong>deceleration in revenue growth</strong> (from over 50% annually to 26% in FY2024). While still robust, managing this moderation while proving profitability sustainability is key. Forensic analysis highlights historical volatility, particularly the <strong>divergence between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow</strong> (negative in FY22, strongly positive in FY24), primarily driven by non-cash items like SBC and significant working capital swings.",
          "Encouragingly, SoFi significantly <strong>improved its financial health in FY2024 through deleveraging</strong> and demonstrated strong OCF generation. Yet, the path forward involves balancing growth ambitions across its segments (Lending, Financial Services, Tech Platform) with consistent profitability and cash flow. Given the historical volatility and moderating growth, a <strong>cautiously optimistic stance</strong> is warranted, acknowledging both the potential and the inherent risks."
