        "Carnival Corporation is demonstrating a strong operational recovery following the catastrophic impact of the pandemic, evidenced by returning passenger volumes, robust booking trends, and a return to profitability in FY2024. Revenue growth is normalizing after the initial surge, and operating cash flow generation has rebounded significantly.",
        "The company's financial narrative is dominated by the massive debt burden incurred during the crisis. Management's primary strategic focus is now squarely on <strong>aggressive deleveraging</strong>, using improved cash flows to pay down debt and repair the balance sheet. Significant progress has been made, with over $8 billion in debt reduction from the peak and improving leverage ratios like Net Debt/EBITDA.",
        "Despite the positive operational momentum and clear deleveraging path, CCL remains a high-risk investment due to the sheer scale of its remaining debt. Continued success hinges on sustained consumer demand, effective cost management, and disciplined execution of the debt reduction strategy. The divergence between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow observed during the recovery highlights the importance of monitoring cash generation quality."
