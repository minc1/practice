      "Palantir is successfully capitalizing on the AI megatrend, evidenced by its accelerating revenue and powerful margin expansion. The company's strategic position with government and large enterprise clients is undeniable. However, this operational strength is significantly clouded by poor earnings quality. The Q3 2025 results are a prime example, where a <strong>51.1 percentage point gap between Net Income growth and negative Operating Cash Flow growth</strong> indicates that reported profits are not translating into cash, a recurring problem for the company.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The impressive headline profit numbers may be misleading. While the AI growth story is compelling, the company consistently struggles to collect cash as quickly as it books sales. This is a major yellow flag. Before investing, you should demand to see at least two consecutive quarters where cash flow from operations is positive and grows in line with or faster than net income. Until then, the risk is that you are paying for <strong>profits that exist on paper but not in the bank.</strong>"
