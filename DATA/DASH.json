      "DoorDash is navigating a critical transition from hyper-growth to demonstrating sustainable profitability. While revenue growth remains robust, it has significantly decelerated from pandemic highs, shifting focus towards operational efficiency and achieving a major milestone with its <strong>first full year of GAAP net income in FY2024</strong>.",
      "Despite this progress, forensic analysis reveals significant complexities. Quarterly profitability and operating cash flow remain highly volatile, often diverging due to substantial <strong>Stock-Based Compensation</strong> and large, unpredictable swings in <strong>working capital</strong>. A key red flag emerged in FY2024 with <strong>Accounts Receivable growth (+62.3%) far outpacing revenue growth (+24.2%)</strong>, demanding scrutiny regarding cash conversion and revenue quality.",
      "DASH benefits from <strong>market leadership, expansion into new verticals, and a strong balance sheet with minimal debt</strong>. However, investors must weigh these strengths against the risks of slowing growth, inconsistent cash flow generation relative to earnings, the dilutive impact of SBC, and intense competition. The path to consistent, predictable profitability remains the central challenge."
