          "Baidu is navigating a critical transition, leveraging its AI strengths (Cloud, ERNIE, Apollo) to counterbalance persistent weakness in its core online marketing business, which faces macroeconomic and competitive headwinds. While the company maintains a <strong>strong balance sheet</strong> with significant net cash and declining debt, its overall financial performance is marked by inconsistency and volatility.",
          "Forensic analysis reveals significant red flags demanding investor caution. The most critical is the sharp <strong>divergence between rising Net Income (+17.0%) and collapsing Operating Cash Flow (-42.0%) in FY2024</strong>, raising serious questions about earnings quality and cash conversion. This follows a major anomaly in FY2022 where <strong>Accounts Receivable (+42.5%) spiked</strong> despite declining revenue (-0.7%), suggesting prior issues with collections or recognition practices.",
          "While Baidu's AI potential is significant, the path to successful monetization remains uncertain. The combination of core business pressures, extreme profitability volatility, and critical cash flow/working capital anomalies necessitates a <strong>cautious investment stance</strong>. Close monitoring of cash generation, receivables management, and AI segment performance is essential."
