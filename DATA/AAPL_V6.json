      "Apple has built one of the world's most valuable enterprises on a foundation of strong, cash-backed earnings and exceptional brand power. Historically, its growth has been accompanied by robust cash conversion and expanding margins, reflecting a deep competitive moat.",
      "However, recent performance in FY2023-2024 and forecasts for FY2025 reveal significant stress. To achieve modest growth, the company is exhibiting signs of aggressive sales practices, evidenced by a critical 4.3x A/R-to-Revenue growth ratio in FY2024. This is compounded by a two-year trend of inventory growing much faster than sales, signaling weakening demand. The forecast for FY2025 points to a severe cash conversion problem, with operating cash flow projected to decline -5.7% while net income grows +19.5%.",
      "These forensic flags indicate that the quality of Apple's earnings is deteriorating. While the company's solvency is not in question, the balance sheet is being used to mask slowing momentum in the income statement. A continuation of these trends would increase the risk of future margin pressure from discounting and potential earnings write-downs. The verdict will only improve upon a demonstrated return to growth that is not dependent on working capital expansion."

      "<strong>Inventory vs. COGS Growth Spread:</strong> Inventory growth has exceeded COGS growth for two years. This spread must turn negative to indicate demand is absorbing supply, removing the risk of future write-downs.",
      "<strong>OCF vs. NI Growth:</strong> FY2025 projects a -25.2 percentage point divergence. OCF growth must meet or exceed Net Income growth to restore confidence that earnings are cash-backed."
