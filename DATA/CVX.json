      "Chevron is a world-class operator in a highly cyclical industry, but its recent financial performance warrants caution. While the company reported a robust 42.1% increase in Net Income in Q3 2025, this figure is not supported by cash flow. The <strong>34-percentage-point gap between profit growth and operating cash flow growth (+7.7%)</strong> is a major concern, suggesting that a large portion of these earnings are accrual-based (recorded on paper, not yet cash) and may not translate into shareholder value in the near term.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> Don't be misled by the headline profit number. The real story is in the cash flow statement, which shows the business is struggling to convert its sales into hard cash. If you own this stock for its dividend, you should be aware that this level of cash generation may not sustainably cover it without borrowing. This is a significant yellow flag. Before making any decisions, <strong>watch the next earnings report for a major improvement in operating cash flow</strong> relative to net income."

      "<strong>Margin Leverage (Cost Control):</strong> In Q3 2025, Gross Profit growth (+5.67%) lagged Revenue growth (+8.55%). This trend must reverse. Seeing Gross Profit grow faster than Revenue would signal costs are under control.",
