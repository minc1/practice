          "Eli Lilly is undergoing a period of exceptional growth, fundamentally reshaped by the blockbuster success of its GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. This has driven <strong>remarkable revenue acceleration</strong> in FY2023-FY2024. The underlying operational strength is evident in robust Operating Income growth.",
          "However, this growth narrative is accompanied by significant financial complexity and volatility. Forensic analysis reveals a stark and frequent <strong>divergence between reported Net Income and Operating Cash Flow</strong>. Net Income is heavily distorted by non-cash M&A accounting (IPR&D charges), while OCF is subject to large swings from working capital management (especially inventory builds for scaling GLP-1s and AR fluctuations) and massive capital investments.",
          "The company has strategically increased leverage, taking on substantial debt to fund crucial M&A and an unprecedented manufacturing expansion. While currently manageable due to strong performance, this adds financial risk. Investors must look beyond headline numbers, weighing the immense growth potential against execution risks (manufacturing, M&A integration), concentration risk (GLP-1 reliance), and the inherent volatility highlighted by forensic metrics."
