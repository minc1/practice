      "e.l.f. Beauty stands out for its <strong>phenomenal revenue acceleration</strong>, achieving an exceptional +76.9% growth in FY2024, driven by strong organic market share gains and the Naturium acquisition. This top-line success has translated into impressive recent <strong>Net Income growth</strong> (+107.5% in FY24), supported by healthy gross margins and emerging operating leverage.",
      "However, the forensic analysis reveals a critical counterpoint: <strong>persistently weak Operating Cash Flow (OCF) conversion</strong>. The stark divergence in FY2024 (NI +107.5% vs. OCF -30.2%), echoing similar gaps in prior years, is a major red flag. This is primarily driven by the substantial investment required in <strong>working capital (especially receivables)</strong> to fuel hyper-growth, raising questions about the quality and cash realization of reported earnings.",
      "While ELF boasts a <strong>strong balance sheet</strong> with declining leverage and efficient inventory management recently, the sustainability of its trajectory hinges on improving cash generation. Investors must weigh the allure of explosive growth against the risks associated with volatile OCF and high working capital demands. A <strong>cautious approach</strong> is warranted, focusing on cash flow dynamics."
