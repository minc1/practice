      "AbbVie is navigating the decline of its mega-blockbuster Humira by growing its newer assets, but this transition is causing significant financial turbulence. While the company's ability to generate cash remains a core strength, the quality of its reported earnings is inconsistent. The most recent quarter highlights this tension: <strong>a -7.0% collapse in gross margin in Q3 2025</strong> signals severe profitability pressure, yet operating cash flow surged. This divergence, combined with a history of inventory issues and rising debt, suggests reported Net Income is not a reliable guide to the company's health.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The stock's story is complicated right now. Don't take the headline earnings per share (EPS) number at face value. The real story is in the gross margin and cash flow statement. The key question is whether the Q3 2025 profit drop was a one-time issue or the start of a new, weaker trend. Before making a decision, <strong>wait for the next earnings report to see if gross margins recover.</strong> If they don't, the company's ability to fund its dividend and growth could be at risk."

      "<strong>Receivables vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> A red flag appeared in Q1 2025 when receivables (money owed by customers) grew much faster than sales. While resolved by Q3 2025, any quarter where this ratio exceeds 2.0x signals potential aggressive sales tactics.",
      "<strong>Leverage Trend (Debt vs. Equity):</strong> In FY2024, debt grew +12.8% while equity fell -67.9%. Monitor the annual balance sheet to ensure equity begins to grow again. Continued erosion of the equity base increases long-term financial risk."
