      "Meta Platforms operates one of the most powerful business models in the world, built on the network effects of its social media platforms. However, its financial statements are often noisy. The Q3 2025 results are a perfect example: a headline Net Income collapse of -85% was driven almost entirely by a <strong>$2.8 billion non-cash legal settlement</strong>. Beneath this accounting charge, the company's Operating Cash Flow grew a healthy +17%. This highlights the core analytical challenge: separating the incredibly profitable and cash-generative advertising business from the volatile impacts of legal battles and heavy spending on future bets like the metaverse.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> Don't get spooked by volatile headline earnings. For Meta, Operating Cash Flow is a much better indicator of the company's health than Net Income. The recurring legal charges are a cost of doing business in this industry and should be viewed as such. Your focus should be on whether the core ad business continues to grow and generate cash. As long as it does, the company has ample firepower to fund its future bets and return capital to you. <strong>Consider the reported earnings as a guide, but cash flow as the truth.</strong>"

      "<strong>G&A Expense Volatility:</strong> In Q3 2025, G&A surged +31.9% due to a legal charge. Watch for future quarterly G&A growth swings greater than +/- 20%, as this signals more large, one-time items are distorting core profitability.",
      "<strong>Cash Conversion Spread (OCF vs. NI growth):</strong> In FY2024, OCF growth lagged NI growth by 31.1 percentage points. Monitor this spread in upcoming Q4 2025 results. A sustained negative spread above 20pp would indicate weakening earnings quality.",
      "<strong>Leverage Trend:</strong> From FY2021-2024, debt grew faster than equity. Watch the Debt-to-Equity ratio in the Q4 2025 balance sheet. A stabilization or decline would be a positive signal that the trend of adding leverage is pausing."
