      "Meta is executing a successful operational turnaround, with re-accelerating revenue growth and high-quality collections. However, the quality of its reported earnings is mixed. The most recent data for Q3 2025 projects a massive 102-point divergence between operating cash flow growth (+17.3%) and net income growth (-85.0%), indicating a large non-cash charge is expected to obscure strong underlying cash generation. This follows a pattern seen in FY2024 where net income growth (+59.5%) significantly outpaced OCF growth (+28.4%), pointing to a growing reliance on accrual accounting.",
      "Looking forward, the primary challenge is to prove that the dramatic margin expansion is sustainable once the flattering base effects from 2023's restructuring charges are fully annualized. The verdict would improve if the company demonstrates durable operating leverage by keeping core expense growth below revenue growth, and if cash conversion strengthens. The assessment would deteriorate if core OpEx re-accelerates or if the gap between net income and operating cash flow widens, suggesting the 'Year of Efficiency' was a one-time fix rather than a structural change."
