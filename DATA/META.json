The '<strong>Year of Efficiency</strong>' initiatives drove significant <strong>profitability improvements</strong>, with Net Income growth surging alongside re-accelerated revenue growth, fueled by AI-enhanced ad performance. The company maintains robust <strong>Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow</strong> generation, supporting substantial capital returns to shareholders.",

While <strong>Operating Cash Flow growth lagged Net Income growth in 2024</strong>, this divergence appears manageable and partially attributable to working capital timing. Expense volatility and the scale of investments in AI and the Metaverse warrant continued monitoring.",
