      "General Electric, now primarily an aerospace and energy pure-play, has made significant strides in simplifying its business and strengthening its balance sheet. However, the quality of its recent earnings is mixed. The most critical finding is the <strong>margin compression in Q3 2025</strong>, where the cost of revenue grew +13.4% versus only +10.9% revenue growth. This indicates that for every new dollar of sales, profitability is shrinking, a concerning trend that undermines the growth story.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The good news is that GE is generating real cash, a welcome change from its past. The bad news is that its core business is becoming less profitable on new sales. You should view the current situation with caution. The stock's future performance depends on whether this margin squeeze is a temporary blip from inflation or a permanent loss of pricing power. <strong>Focus on the gross margin trend</strong> in the next earnings report; if it worsens, the foundation of the recovery story is at risk."

      "<strong>Gross Margin Spread (Revenue Growth vs. COGS Growth):</strong> In Q3 2025, this was negative by -2.5 percentage points. Watch for this spread to turn positive in the next quarter, which would signal that GE has regained control over its costs or pricing.",
      "<strong>Inventory Growth vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> A major flag was raised in FY2024 and Q1 2025 when inventory grew much faster than sales. Monitor Q4 2025 inventory levels; another quarter of inventory outpacing revenue would confirm a demand problem.",
      "<strong>Cash Conversion (OCF Growth vs. NI Growth):</strong> Q3 2025 was strong, with OCF growing 2x faster than NI. Ensure this continues. A return to NI growth significantly outpacing OCF growth would indicate a relapse into 'paper profit' territory."
