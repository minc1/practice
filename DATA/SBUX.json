          "Starbucks' recent financial performance paints a challenging picture. After a strong post-pandemic recovery through FY2023, the company experienced a <strong>sharp deceleration in FY2024</strong>, with near-flat revenue growth and declining profitability. This slowdown, confirmed by weak quarterly results extending into early FY2025, reflects significant headwinds from slowing traffic, intense competition, and macroeconomic pressures.",
          "Forensic analysis highlights several areas of concern: the high volatility in quarterly earnings, significant swings in working capital (particularly <strong>inventory issues in FY22/FY23</strong>), and a notable <strong>divergence between declining Net Income and slightly positive Operating Cash Flow in FY2024</strong>, driven by non-cash items. While the company maintains a strong brand, its financial health shows signs of stress with a volatile equity base and weakening interest coverage.",
          "The success of the ongoing <strong>'Back to Starbucks' turnaround plan</strong> is critical but carries significant execution risk and is pressuring near-term margins. Given the current lack of growth momentum, profitability pressures, and operational volatility, a <strong>cautious investment stance</strong> is warranted. Close monitoring of key performance indicators is essential to gauge the effectiveness of the turnaround strategy."
