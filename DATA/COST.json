      "Costco's powerful business model is undeniable, built on membership loyalty and immense scale. However, recent financial data reveals significant earnings quality concerns. In FY2024, <strong>receivables grew 3.8 times faster than revenue</strong>, a pattern that worsened with a critical negative divergence in Q1 2025. This, combined with severe cash flow disconnects like in Q4 2024 where profits rose 40% while cash flow fell, suggests reported earnings are not consistently translating into cash.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> These are not signs of a failing business, but they are yellow flags about how profits are being generated. The 'paper profits' mean cash is tied up paying suppliers or waiting for customer payments. Before adding to a position, you should demand to see the company's cash conversion improve. If the gap between profit growth and cash flow growth continues to widen, the stock's premium valuation may be at risk as the market questions the quality of its earnings."

      "<strong>Receivables vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> In Q1 2025, receivables grew while revenue fell sharply. Watch for the next quarter's A/R growth to be below revenue growth. If it outpaces sales again, it signals a worsening cash collection problem.",
      "<strong>Cash Conversion (OCF vs. NI):</strong> In Q4 2024, OCF growth was 41 points lower than NI growth. Monitor the full-year FY2025 OCF/NI ratio (how much profit turns to cash). A ratio below 0.9x would confirm persistent earnings quality issues.",
      "<strong>Inventory vs. Sales Growth:</strong> In FY2024, inventory grew 2.6x faster than COGS. Watch for inventory growth in FY2025 to align with or fall below revenue growth. This would prove the recent build-up was temporary, not a sign of weakening demand."
