          "Costco demonstrates remarkable resilience, leveraging its powerful <strong>membership model and strong value proposition</strong> to navigate a period of growth moderation following pandemic-era highs. While revenue growth slowed in FY23-FY24, profitability remained robust, with Net Income growth outpacing sales in FY24, highlighting effective cost management and the benefit of high-margin membership fees.",
          "Forensic analysis reveals key areas for monitoring despite the overall financial strength. The most notable are the <strong>significant volatility in Operating Cash Flow</strong>, driven by large swings in working capital inherent to Costco's efficient model, and specific flags in FY2024 where <strong>Inventory (+12.0%) and Accounts Receivable (+19.1%) grew substantially faster than Revenue (+5.0%)</strong>. These divergences require scrutiny regarding operational efficiency and asset management.",
          "Despite these flags, Costco's <strong>conservative financial policies, low debt, strong balance sheet, and consistent cash generation</strong> provide significant stability. The company presents a profile of a high-quality, mature retailer, but investors should monitor working capital efficiency and be mindful of the stock's typically high valuation. A <strong>stable outlook</strong> is appropriate, contingent on effective management of inventory and receivables."
