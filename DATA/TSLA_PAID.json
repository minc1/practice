      "Tesla's financial profile has deteriorated from 'Strong Quality' (2020-2021) to a regime of <strong>stagnation and aggressive financial management</strong>. The transition is marked by the collapse of operating leverage in 2023 (Gross Profit Ratio -28.7%) and the stalling of top-line growth in 2024 (+0.95%). While Q3 2025 shows signs of a rebound, the underlying quality of recent periods is heavily compromised by working capital distortions.",
      "Forensic analysis identifies a <strong>critical red flag in revenue quality</strong>. In FY2024, Net Receivables grew +25.9% while Revenue was essentially flat (+0.95%)\u2014a <strong>27x divergence</strong>. This pattern repeated in Q4 2024 (16x divergence). This is a textbook signal of channel stuffing or extended payment terms used to meet volume targets, creating 'paper revenue' that has not yet converted to cash. Additionally, FY2023 and Q4 2024 exhibited severe 'accrual-driven' earnings, where Net Income significantly outperformed Operating Cash Flow.",
      "The verdict is 'Significant Flags / High Risk' due to the magnitude of the A/R divergence and the recurring nature of the Q4 'stuffing' pattern. While the company retains scale and recent margin improvement (Q3 '25), the reliance on balance sheet expansion to drive headline numbers suggests organic demand is softer than reported. Investors must see a normalization of the A/R-to-Revenue relationship to regain confidence in the quality of growth."

      "<strong>OCF vs Net Income Gap:</strong> Watch for 'Paper Profits'. A gap >15pp where NI > OCF (like Q4 '24) confirms low-quality earnings. OCF growth must match or exceed NI growth in FY2025.",
      "<strong>Short-Term Debt Growth:</strong> Spiked +45% in Q3 2025. Further spikes >20% without corresponding CapEx indicate debt is being used to plug liquidity holes from uncollected receivables."
