While Q3 2025 showed a healthy reversal with strong cash flow (OCF +17.6%), it followed a period of significant stress, including a 'paper profit' quarter in Q1 2025 where a 4.5% inventory build on declining revenue caused a 31-point OCF vs. NI growth gap.",

The multi-year inventory glut suggests a disconnect between production and demand, a problem that must be resolved to restore earnings quality. The verdict would improve if management demonstrates sustained control over working capital.

      "<strong>A/R vs. Revenue Growth:</strong> Q3 2024 ratio was 2.7x. While Q3 2025 was healthy, this ratio must remain below 1.5x in future quarters, especially during periods of slow revenue growth, to validate disciplined sales practices."
