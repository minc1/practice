            "NVIDIA has undergone a dramatic transformation, pivoting from a cyclical downturn in FY2023 to become the engine of the AI revolution, delivering <strong>staggering revenue and profitability growth</strong> in FY2024 and FY2025. Driven by unprecedented demand for its Data Center accelerators, the company demonstrated immense operating leverage and significantly strengthened its balance sheet through massive retained earnings.",
            "However, forensic analysis flags areas demanding scrutiny. The most significant is the persistent trend of <strong>Accounts Receivable growth outpacing Revenue growth</strong> during boom periods (FY22, FY24, FY25), raising questions about collection velocity or revenue recognition timing. Additionally, managing <strong>inventory and working capital</strong> through extreme demand shifts remains challenging, impacting Operating Cash Flow conversion efficiency despite overall strong cash generation.",
            "While NVDA's current financial health is robust with low leverage, its future relies heavily on the <strong>sustainability of the AI spending cycle</strong> and maintaining its competitive edge. The extreme growth rates are unlikely to persist indefinitely. Investors must weigh the company's dominant market position and phenomenal recent performance against inherent cyclicality, working capital risks, geopolitical factors, and a high valuation. A <strong>selective approach</strong> is warranted, acknowledging both the immense potential and significant risks."
