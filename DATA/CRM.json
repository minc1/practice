This 17x divergence strongly suggests that sales are being pulled forward on paper to meet targets, a practice that is not sustainable and masks underlying demand softness.",

While the balance sheet is strong, you should treat the headline revenue and profit numbers with caution. The key risk is that this isn't a one-time trick, but a new pattern to hide slowing growth. <strong>Watch the next Q2 report (July 2026) very closely</strong>; if this 10x+ receivables spike repeats, it confirms a systemic issue with how the company books its sales."

      "<strong>OCF vs. NI Growth (The 'Paper Profit' Test):</strong> OCF collapsed -88.6% in Q2 2025 despite +22.5% NI growth. Future quarters must show OCF growth tracking NI growth. A negative OCF in any quarter would be a major warning sign.",
      "<strong>Revenue Growth Momentum (The Demand Signal):</strong> Revenue growth slowed to just +0.2% in Q3 2025 after the Q2 sales push. A return to sustained growth above 5% would signal that the business is growing organically again, not just financially engineering its results."
