      "Bank of America's recent performance highlights a critical tension between its market strength and the underlying quality of its financial results. While revenue has surged in the new rate environment, profitability has not followed suit. The core issue is a structural margin squeeze, where the cost of funding is rising faster than asset yields. This is compounded by a history of low-quality earnings, where profit growth, like the <strong>+79% surge in FY2021, was driven by non-cash accounting reversals</strong>, not actual cash flow, a pattern that continued into FY2024.",
      "<strong>What this means for you:</strong> The reported profit numbers for BAC may not be telling the whole story. The bank is running harder just to stand still. The recent decision to rapidly increase debt faster than equity is a strategy to prop up returns, but it adds risk. You should view headline 'earnings beats' with skepticism and instead focus on whether the bank can generate actual cash. This is a <strong>yellow flag indicating the business model is under stress</strong>, warranting caution until cash flow consistently backs up reported profits."

      "<strong>Cash Conversion (OCF/NI Ratio):</strong> The ratio of cash from operations to net income was negative in FY2024. Monitor for this ratio to stay consistently above 1.0x, which would prove that reported profits are backed by real cash.",
      "<strong>Operating Leverage:</strong> In FY2023, revenue grew +49% while operating income fell. Watch for operating income growth to exceed revenue growth, which would show the bank has fixed its funding cost issues and restored profitability."
