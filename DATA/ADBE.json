          "Adobe stands as a mature leader in the software industry, underpinned by a highly successful and resilient subscription model that generates predictable revenue and substantial operating cash flow. The hyper-growth phase driven by the cloud transition has moderated to a still-healthy ~10-12% annual revenue growth.",
          "Forensic analysis highlights strong core profitability but significant volatility in reported GAAP Net Income, often impacted by one-off events (like the Figma termination fee) and operating expense timing. Operating Cash Flow, while robust long-term, exhibits considerable quarterly and annual volatility driven primarily by large working capital swings, necessitating analysis beyond single periods.",
          "A key recent development is the strategic shift towards increased leverage, utilizing debt to fund a massive share repurchase program. While this boosts EPS and signals confidence, it has raised the Debt/Equity ratio. However, Adobe's exceptional interest coverage provides a substantial safety margin. Investors should weigh the stability of the core business and strong cash generation against moderating growth, execution risks (especially AI monetization), and the implications of the evolving capital structure."
