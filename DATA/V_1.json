      "Visa represents a fundamentally superior business with a wide competitive moat, evidenced by two decades of powerful growth, elite profitability, and massive cash generation. Its financial history has been shaped by transformative events like the 2008 IPO and 2016 Visa Europe acquisition, which introduced periodic, significant non-recurring charges.",
      "However, the most critical forensic finding is a recurring pattern where <strong>Net Receivables growth dramatically outpaces Revenue growth</strong>. This has occurred in multiple years, including as recently as FY2024, and is a significant red flag for aggressive accounting practices or deteriorating commercial terms. This practice temporarily reduces the quality of earnings by creating 'paper profits' that are not yet converted to cash, a trend confirmed by periodic divergences between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow.",
      "While Visa's market dominance and financial strength are not in question, the persistent earnings quality issues warrant a cautious approach. Investors must look beyond headline growth figures and critically assess cash conversion metrics. The company's ability to discipline its working capital management will be key to validating the long-term quality and sustainability of its impressive financial performance."
