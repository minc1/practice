        "Delta Air Lines has successfully navigated the post-pandemic era, achieving a strong operational recovery and making significant strides in repairing its balance sheet through <strong>aggressive deleveraging</strong>, culminating in the restoration of its investment-grade credit ratings. The rapid recovery growth phase, however, has clearly transitioned to a period of normalization, with revenue growth slowing to more typical single-digit levels.",
        "Despite the balance sheet improvements, recent performance reveals challenges. FY2024 saw a notable <strong>decline in Net Income despite revenue growth</strong>, indicating significant margin pressure from costs like labor and fuel. Furthermore, a key forensic finding is the recurring and significant <strong>divergence between Operating Cash Flow and Net Income</strong>, particularly stark in FY2024, which necessitates careful monitoring of cash flow quality and the impact of working capital and non-cash adjustments.",
        "While DAL benefits from a strong brand and premium focus, its outlook is tempered by macroeconomic sensitivity, recent signs of softening domestic demand, and ongoing cost pressures. Investors should weigh the improved financial health against the inherent cyclicality of the airline industry and the recent profitability headwinds."
